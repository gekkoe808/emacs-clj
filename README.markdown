# Emacs for Clojure with Evil 

This repo is a minor extension of [The Emacs Starter Kit, v2](https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit/tree/v2).

It was originally copied from https://github.com/flyingmachine/emacs-for-clojure.git as a part of a tutorial at http://www.braveclojure.com and then hybridized with my personal emacs environment to enable evil and some other goodies.
